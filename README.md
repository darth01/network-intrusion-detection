## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a robust network intrusion detection system. We use machine learning techniques to classify network traffic into normal and malicious categories. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/darth01/network-intrusion-detection.git
   cd network-intrusion-detection
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the main Python script:
   ```
   python network_intrusion_detection.py
   ```
 
## Usage

1. Data Preprocessing: Explore data preprocessing steps.
2. Model Training: Train intrusion detection models.
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance.

## Models

We have implemented and trained the following models:

1. Naive Bayes Classifier
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
4. Logistic Regression Classifier

## Evaluation

We assessed model performance using cross-validation and key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
